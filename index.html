              <span class="first-character sc">K</span>yrgyz is a Turkic
              language of the Kipchak branch, closely related to Kazakh,
              Karakalpak, and Nogay Tatar. It was written in the Arabic alphabet
              until the twentieth century. The Latin script was introduced and
              adopted on Stalin's orders in 1928, and was subsequently replaced
              by Cyrillic script in 1941.[132] A reformed Perso-Arabic alphabet,
              created by the Kyrgyz intellectual and scientist Kasym Tynystanov
              is the official script of the Kyrgyz language in the People's
              Republic of China.[133] As a result of the pending language reform
              in neighboring Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan will be the only independent
              Turkic-speaking country in a few years that exclusively uses the
              Cyrillic alphabet.[134] In April 2023, Russia suspended dairy
              exports to Kyrgyzstan after the chairman of Kyrgyzstan's National
              Commission for the State Language and Language Policies, Kanybek
              Osmonaliev, proposed to change the official script from Cyrillic
              to Latin to bring the country in line with other Turkic-speaking
              nations. Osmonaliev was reprimanded by President Sadyr Japarov who
              then clarified that Kyrgyzstan had no plans to replace the
              Cyrillic alphabet.[135]

              In 2009,[136] 4.1 million people spoke Kyrgyz as native or second
              language and 2.5 million spoke Russian as native or second
              language. Uzbek is the second most common native language with
              700,000 native speakers. Russian TV media enjoy enormous
              popularity in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the deeply russified city
              of Bishkek and the Chüy Region, despite that the percentage of
              Russians today is a fraction of that in 1989. Russian media
              outlets have an enormous influence on public opinion in
              Kyrgyzstan, especially in areas such as human rights and
              international political developments.[137]

              IPA: [biʃˈkek]; Russian: Бишкек), formerly Pishpek and Frunze, is
              the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan. Bishkek is also the
              administrative centre of the Chüy Region. The region surrounds the
              city, although the city itself is not part of the region but
              rather a region-level unit of Kyrgyzstan. Bishkek is situated near
              the border with Kazakhstan and has a population of 1,074,075, as
              of 2021.[6] Bishkek is the primate city of Kyrgyzstan—it is the
              sole metropolis in the country, and about 17% of all inhabitants
              of the country live in Bishkek's metropolitan area.

              The Khanate of Kokand established the fortress of Pishpek in 1825
              to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz
              tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz,
              Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the
              fortress. In the present day, the fortress ruins can be found just
              north of Jibek jolu street, near the new main mosque.[7] A Russian
              settlement was established in 1868 on the site of the fortress
              under its original name, Pishpek. It lay within the General
              Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast.

              kœl]) is an endorheic (i.e., without outflow) saline lake in the
              western Tianshan Mountains in eastern Kyrgyzstan, just south of a
              dividing range separating Kyrgyzstan from Kazakhstan. It is the
              seventh-deepest lake in the world, the tenth-largest lake in the
              world by volume (though not in surface area), the deepest lake
              whose deepest point is above sea level (939 meters or 3080 feet),
              and the third-largest saline lake. Issyk-Kul means "warm lake" in
              the Kyrgyz language; although it is located at a lofty elevation
              of 1,607 metres (5,272 ft) and subject to severe cold during
              winter, it rarely freezes, due to the salinity.[5][6]

              Issyk-Kul Lake was a stopover on the Silk Road, a land route for
              travelers from the Far East to Europe. The great Chinese Buddhist
              scholar-monk Xuanzang passed by this lake and noted the details in
              the classic travelogue Great Tang Records on the Western Regions
              in the 7th century. The lake was once a part of the territory of
              Qing Dynasty of China and was ceded to Russia – along with the
              surrounding territory – after the Treaty of Tarbagatai.[citatio
